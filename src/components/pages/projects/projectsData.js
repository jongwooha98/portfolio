      'Our goal for this project was to build and design electro-hydraulic control systems. With this control system, a user can actuate a hydraulic tool and receive feedback from pressure sensors. The control system will contain a user interface, control electronics, a brushless DC motor, hydraulic pump and a hydraulic reservoir.',
